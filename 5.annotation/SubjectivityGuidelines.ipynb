    "I found this exercise difficult! But I'll try to write out my logic on whether text is subjective or objective. If the text expresses an opinion that is not factual. Take these two examples. First, imagine someone telling you \"Tigers are the best big cats.\" This is clearly an opinion, and one not based in a falsifiable claim. There is no way you can test whether or not they are the best conditional on what this person believes that will get you to some objective reality. Now take another example: \"It is raining outside.\" If someone comes up to you and tells you this (a person, not your weather app), then they are describing a verifiable fact about the world without judgement. Now, my definition does not account for if speakers are lying. I cannot tell from text if someone says \"The sky is blue today,\" but actually the sky has turned a roiling pink and we just haven't noticed. I assume the intent of speakers is to tell the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other dimensions to subjectivity and objectivity. People may say things confidently and declaratively (assume a voice we often associate with objectivity) while stating a claim we *know* to be wrong. This is subjective, because it is no longer based in fact. For example, \"vaccines cause autism,\" is a subjective statement. This means that my classification of what is subjective versus objective will differ from someone who is a flat-earther, for example. Someone may make a statement that is factual but embed judgements in it, such as \"the trading value of stock X is now at 50 dollars a share, which is extremely low.\" That \"extremeley low\" is a judgement on $50/share, and makes the document subjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, any admission of personal lens puts a text in the subjective category. If someone were to say \"I think it's raining outside,\" that introduces subjectivity and personal observation. Texts like \"I believe in God,\" \"I want ice cream,\" and \"I think Texas is in the United States\" are all subjective because they invoke this personal quality."
